# Exercise 6: dplyr join operations

# Install the `nycflights13` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
#install.packages("nycflights13")  # should be done already
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# Create a dataframe of the average arrival delays for each _destination_, then 
# use `left_join()` to join on the "airports" dataframe, which has the airport
# information
# Which airport had the largest average arrival delay?
average_arr_del <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(faa = dest)
largest_arrival_delay <- average_arr_del %>%
  left_join(airports, by = 'faa') %>%
  filter(avg_delay == max(avg_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
# CAE had the largest average arrival delay

# Create a dataframe of the average arrival delay for each _airline_, then use
# `left_join()` to join on the "airlines" dataframe
# Which airline had the smallest average arrival delay?
airline_arr_delay <- flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
smallest_airline_delay <- airline_arr_delay %>%
  left_join(airlines, by='carrier') %>%
  filter(avg_delay == max(avg_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
# Frontier Airlinesn Inc. had the smallest average arrival delay
